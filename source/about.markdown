#About me

I'm an undergraduate student in Dalian University of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering, though I hardly dare to say so in public... Well, don't mind.

I speak three languages, Chinese, English and Japanese, sorted by descending proficiency. I plan to attend JLPT N2 this year, and have got a job offer from a Japanese company. Yes, I'm a big fan of Japanese culture.

I've been using Linux for more than 5 years. It's not a long time, but not short either, as I've never lived more than 4 times of it \(so far\). My favorate distribution is ArchLinux. I've tried LFS, but it was hard to update, and didn't have a nice package manager.

I'm still looking for more job offers to decide my first step in career, so if you have a recommendation, please mail me, I'd appreciate it.
